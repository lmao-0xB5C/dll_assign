# data_dllAssign
## What is this?
This is a backup of the second data structures assignment I made. It is a doubly linked list with forward and reverse iterators. With that it has a special Items class which holds different item details, like ID, price etc. This item class can be loaded from a file which follows this pattern:
```
    ID  Name    Price   Category    Company
```
    
**_ALL OF THESE NEED TO HAVE TABS IN BETWEEN THEM_**
